# EvoCalc

Welcome to EvoCalc, a project that showcases the evolution of a simple calculator program across different versions of BASIC, from QBasic to VB.NET. This project highlights how programming techniques and tools have evolved over time.

## Project Overview

EvoCalc is designed to be an educational journey through the history of BASIC programming languages. Starting with a basic implementation in QBasic, we will gradually enhance the calculator by adding features and refactoring the code in subsequent versions, ending with a sophisticated implementation in VB.NET.

## Version History

### Version 1.0 - QBasic
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Simple User Interface**: Text-based input and output in the console.

    #### Version 1.1
    - Refactored to allow code reuse by utilizing subroutines and functions
    - Information bar at the top including program name, version, and special keys
    - Pressing enter after receiving an answer, before typing another value, will continue the calculation

### Future Versions
- **Version 2.0 - QBX 4.5**
- **Version 3.0 - QBX 7.1**
- **Version 4.0 - VBDOS/VB1.0 for Windows**
- **Version 5.0 - VB2**
- **Version 6.0 - VB3**
- **Version 7.0 - VB4**
- **Version 8.0 - VB5**
- **Version 9.0 - VB6**
- **Version 10.0 - VB.NET**

## Getting Started

To get started with EvoCalc, you can clone the repository and explore each version in its respective folder. Each version contains a README with specific instructions on how to run the program in that environment.

### Prerequisites

- QBasic or a compatible emulator (for QBasic versions)
- Visual Basic for DOS (for QBX versions)
- Visual Basic 1.0 to 4.0 (for Windows versions)
- Visual Studio (for VB.NET version)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/timstechretrospect/EvoCalc.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the version you want to run and follow the instructions in the respective README file.
